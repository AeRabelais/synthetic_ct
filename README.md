# [Improving Tuberculosis (TB) Prediction using Synthetically Generated Computed Tomography (CT) Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11480)
*Ashia Lewis, Evanjelin Mahmoodi, Yuyue Zhou, Megan Coffee, Elena Sizikova*

Herein lies the system for the analysis of synthetic CT scans simulating various forms of tuberculosis, as used in the paper. The data first allows for the processing of x-rays into synthetic CT scans, then includes the codebase for (1) the identification of tuberculosis and (2) the classification of modes of tuberculosis. 

## Quantitative Results
